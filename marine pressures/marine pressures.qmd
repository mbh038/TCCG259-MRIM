# Summary Table

| **Issue** | **Marine Resources Affected** | **Main Impacts** | **Example Locations Especially Affected** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Overfishing** | Commercial fish stocks, invertebrates (e.g. squid, crustaceans) | Depletion of target species, disruption of food webs, economic loss for coastal communities | North Atlantic (cod), Western Pacific (tuna), South China Sea |
| **Climate Change (Warming & Ocean Acidification)** | Coral reefs, shellfish, plankton, fish populations | Coral bleaching, reduced calcification, species migration, ecosystem shifts | Great Barrier Reef (Australia), Coral Triangle (SE Asia), Arctic Ocean |
| **Marine Pollution (Plastics & Chemicals)** | All marine life, seabirds, mammals, benthic organisms | Ingestion and entanglement, bioaccumulation of toxins, habitat degradation | North Pacific Gyre, Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean |
| **Coastal Development & Habitat Destruction** | Mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, estuaries | Loss of nursery grounds, reduced coastal protection, biodiversity decline | Southeast Asia, Caribbean, East African coast |
| **Shipping & Underwater Noise Pollution** | Marine mammals (whales, dolphins), fish, plankton | Behavioural disturbance, disrupted communication and navigation, physical injury | North Atlantic shipping lanes, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean |
| **Deep-Sea Mining & Resource Extraction** | Deep-sea corals, benthic invertebrates, mineral-rich sediments | Habitat destruction, sediment plumes, loss of poorly known biodiversity | Clarion-Clipperton Zone (Pacific), Indian Ocean ridges, Mid-Atlantic Ridge |
