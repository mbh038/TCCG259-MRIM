25,000 species already recorded in [World Register of Deep-Sea Species (WoRDSS)](https://www.marinespecies.org/deepsea/index.php), [@mora2011]. Many more are likely to be found.

Life in the deep sea is specially adapted to thrive in areas characterized by

-   high pressure
-   absence of sunlight
-   limited nutrients.

@fig-blasiak_fig3 taken from a comprehensive review paper by Blasiak and co-workers [-@blasiak2022] shows a range of adaptions in the deep sea that can inspire innovations:

Examples include

## The mirrored eyes of mesopelagic teleost fish

No light extends beyond 1000 m into the ocean, but some faint traces of residual daylight persist at depths from 500 to 1000 m

A range of species in this zone produce bioluminescence [@land2009] creating a unique sensory environment. This in turn is associated with the double eye structure often found in species in the depth range 200-1000m: a large eye pointing upwards and a smaller eye pointing downward. Land [-@land2000] describes how this double eye phenomenon, found across three phyla (vertebrates, crustaceans and molluscs) must imply different functions for the two eyes, since the downwelling light is some 200 times more intense than the upwelling light from the depths. He argues that the upward pointing eye is designed to spot the sillhouette of sinking food, and so needs high resolution, while the downward pointing eye is designed to detect flashes of bioluminesence against a dark background. These flashes may come from potential predators. it is sufficient to know of their presence but unnecessary to know their precise location, hence the downward facing eye can have poor resolution and hence be smaller than the upward facing eye.

A number of mesopelagic teleost fishes have evolved unique eyes that benefit from both sources of light (through a combination of reflective and refractive optics)

The two most-studied of these species are the brownsnout spookfish (*Dolichopteryx longipes*) and the glasshead barreleye fish (*Rhynchohyalus natalensis*)

The reflective eyes of decapods like lobsters spurred advances in the field of astrophysics, namely the development of “lobster-eye” X-ray telescopes, and the biomimetic design potential of further telescope innovations focused on the unique tilting of mirror plates in *D. longipes* eyes has been suggested.

A recent study created advanced models to test the optical performance of *D. longipes*, paving the way to the development of optical systems that can function in harsh environments including the deep sea.

Other examples of biomimetic design are found in architecture, where the mirrored eyes of *D. longipes* inspired concepts of energy-saving roof designs by making optimal use of available daylight [@wainwright2014].

## The transparent teeth of the deep-sea dragonfish *Aristostomias stomians*

```

The deep-sea dragonfish (*Aristostomias scintillans*) has virtually transparent teeth, invisible even illuminated from close up by bioluminescent light. This gives them a stealth advantage in the darkness of the deep ocean. The transparency appears to arise from a nanoscale structure that also conributes to its hardness and a sharpness, comparable to the teeth of piranhas and great white sharks. These teeth are a source of inspiration for those seeking to develop transparent ceramics. [@velasco-hogan2019; @ucsandiego2019]

## Motion under high pressure: The morphology of the Mariana snailfish *Pseudoliparis swirei*

The extreme pressures of the deep sea have meant that mechanical joints n the moving part of deep-sea vessels have had to be encased in rigid pressure vessels. However soft creatures that live at these depths seem not to need this. Li and co-workers [-@li2023] studied the snail fish *Pseudoliparis swirei* that inhabits the Mariana trench at depths of over 10000m and inspired by what they found, devised a soft, self-powered robot that could function at these depths.

## Antifouling compounds extracted from deep-sea sponges *Geodia barretti*

Deep-sea sponges such as *Geodia barretti* form siliceous structures that are stiff, strong and highly porous. This has inspired research into possible bone replacement materials that share these properties. These not only need also to be stiff and strong but also to act as scaffolds for other tissues. Other areas of application have been pipe linings and the structural frameworks of large buildings, such as The Gherkin in London's financial district.

## The air-filled shell that provides buoyancy to the Ram’s horn squid *Spirula spirula*;

@fig-spirula-spirula shows the internal shell of Ram's horn squid *Spirula spirula*. By pumping fluid into or out of this shell this species can effect rapid changes in buoyancy. This is needed when rapid changes in depth are required, such as during diel migrations in which this species rises to depths of 100-200 m during he night to feed, then descend to 600-700m at night to hide from predators. In fish, buoyancy is achieved using swim bladders, but these take a long time to equilibrate to ambient pressures and so do not supprt rapid change in depth.

The shape, orientation and buoyancy mechanism of *S. spirula* has been an inspiration in the design of manned deep-sea submersibles such as *Deepsea Challenger* which has been taken to the ocean's deepest point at 10,911m in 2012.
