# ALAN - Artificial Light at Night

For good overviews on the ecological impact of artificial light at night in the marine environment, see Davies *et al*. [-@davies2014] and Marangoni *et al*. [-@marangoni2022].

For a striking specific example of of the extent of the problem, see for example the report Bright Lights Dim Justice [-@environmentaljusticefoundation2025] by The Evironmental Justice Foundation on the concentration of hundreds of fishing, boats in the south Atlantic, most of them hunting short fin squid using a technique known as jigging in which very bright lights are shone directly down into the water to attract the squid.

Gaston *et al.* [-@gaston2021] asserts that the biological impacts of ALAN in marine systems seem likely to be at least as diverse as those occurring terrestrially, with evidence already for:

## Effects on timing of coral spawning 

See Ayalon *et al*. [-@ayalon2021]

## Invertebrate settlement 

See Davies *et al*. [-@davies2015]

## Behavior of pelagic organisms

See Berge *et al.* [-@berge2020]

## Impacts on diel vertical migration of zooplankton could be especially profound, given its importance for global carbon cycling.
